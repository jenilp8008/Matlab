2d unsteady conduction equation
I generated the code for 2D Heat conduction. In which, 2 dimensional plate is given of 1m * 1m dimension and we applied temperature 0 at 3 boundries and 1 degree centigrate temperture and 1 remining boundry. Take 4 random probe points in this plate. We have to find that what is heating time of plate when steady state is achieved at all taken probe points then code will stop running and note the heating time.
